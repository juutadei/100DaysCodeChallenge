# 100DaysCodeChallenge

So, I've decided to breathe life back into my GitHub after quite a long hiatus.

I'm thinking about embarking on the 100-day challenge, committing to coding for at least an hour every day, excluding the hours I put into my college work. I won't strictly adhere to the official challenge rules because I won't be doing it in the conventional way. Additionally, I won't limit myself to a specific programming language during this period, although my primary focus will be on web development, striving to utilize JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as much as possible. I'll also be delving into the C language and exploring other languages should the opportunity arise.

The idea is to work on a few small projects over these 100 days, starting with something modest and gradually taking on more extensive projects as time goes on. The reason I'm jumping into this rather suddenly is that I've been away from real coding for quite some time. It's been a while since I've been actively involved in this field, and I want to get back into it. I need to regain my familiarity with this world, and I won't deny that I also want to spruce up my GitHub profile.

Today (23/09/2023), I'm just initializing the repository. My plan is to kick things off this weekend and not skip a single day from then on. I'll be providing daily updates whenever I make modifications or embark on a new project.
