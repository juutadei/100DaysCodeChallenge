Hey there! 👋 I'm back on GitHub after a bit of a hiatus, and I'm ready to take on a new challenge.

## The Challenge 🚀

I've decided to embark on the [100-day coding challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), committing to code for at least an hour every day (except for those college hours, of course). While I won't strictly follow the official challenge rules, I'm excited to dive back into the coding world. My primary focus will be web development, with a special emphasis on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. However, I won't limit myself to just that; I'll also be exploring the C language and diving into other programming languages as opportunities arise.

## What to Expect 📈

My plan is to work on various projects over these 100 days, starting with small, achievable goals and gradually taking on more ambitious projects as I progress. I'm doing this to reacquaint myself with coding after a bit of a break and to spruce up my GitHub profile. 

## Updates 🗓️

Today (23/09/2023), I'm initializing this repository as the starting point of my journey. I'll officially kick things off this weekend and won't miss a single day from then on. Be sure to stay tuned for daily updates as I make modifications, share my progress, and embark on exciting new projects.

Let's code together and make the next 100 days count! 🎉
