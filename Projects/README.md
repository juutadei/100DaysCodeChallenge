# Projects



### Day 1:

Even though today (09/23/2023) was the day I promised to start the challenge, there were some delays :eyes:. So, just to update before midnight, I started a very basic project from FreeCodeCamp that was about creating a café menu. I chose to start with it because it uses HTML and CSS, which helps me to remember a bit.
