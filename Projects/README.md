### Project 1: Café Menu

Even though today (23/09/2023) was the day I promised to start the challenge, there were some delays :eyes:. So, just to update before midnight, I started a very basic project from FreeCodeCamp that was about creating a café menu. I chose to start with it because it uses HTML and CSS, which helps me to remember a bit.


### Project 2: Minimal Weather App

I'm just starting my second project now, it's a minimalist weather app. I got inspired by the heat records we're facing right now... not fun at all. The project is also inspired by the ASMRprog channel; I watched it and decided to make one myself.
