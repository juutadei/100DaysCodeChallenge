### Project 1: Café Menu ☕
While today (23/09/2023) was the official start date of the challenge, there were some minor delays (I promise, just a few 👀). To keep the momentum going, I began with a straightforward project from FreeCodeCamp. It's all about creating a café menu, a perfect choice to kickstart the challenge since it involves HTML and CSS. It's an excellent refresher!

### Project 2: Minimal Weather App 🌦️
I've just started my second project, a minimalist weather app. The inspiration for this one came from the scorching heat records we're experiencing right now—definitely not a pleasant experience. The project is also inspired by the ASMRprog channel; I watched it and got inspired to create one myself.

### Project 3: Classic Form 📝
The third project is going to be the classic HTML form. It's been a while since I've created a form, so it might take more than a day 🤡. And i'm also using a <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">FreeCodeCamp project.</a>
